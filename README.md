## UK Biobank Updates

**July 27th, 2017 - Errors in imputation identified**
  * Imputation of non-HRC SNPs was mis-mapped. Email details below:
```
We have identified a problem with the UK Biobank imputed data and which has come to light following discussion via the UKB-GENETICS mail list.
This problem relates to the imputed data and does not affect the genotyped data from the Affymetrix array. 
The genetic data was imputed using two different reference panels.
The Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel was used as first choice option, but for SNPs not in that reference panel the UK10K + 1000 Genomes panel was used.
The problem arose in the second set of imputed data from the UK10K + 1000 Genomes panel.
The genotypes at these SNPs are imputed correctly, but have not been recorded as having the correct genome position in the files.
We have established that the imputed data from the HRC panel is not affected and has the correct positions.
This is about ~40M sites and will include the majority of the common SNPs i.e. sites most likely to show genetic associations.
These sites are readily identified since the HRC site list is public
http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/site
The problem is not easy to fix post-hoc, so we intend to re-impute the data from the UK10K + 1000 Genomes panel and re-release the imputed data.
For now we recommend that researchers focus exclusively on SNPs in the HRC panel, or work with the directly genotyped data until the new release is available.
We will progress the re-imputation as quickly as we can and expect to release a new version of the imputed files ideally in September.
We will send more details about this data release and confirm timelines in due course. 
We can only apologise that this error was not identified during the QA review and do not underestimate the frustration this will cause for the research community.
```

### Phenotype to Genotype linking
  * The main link files from application to UK Biobank imputed dataset are the **.fam** and **.sample** file
  * Both files have the same IDs
  	* The .fam file is ordered the same way as the ukb_sqc_v2.txt file
  	* The .sample file is ordered the same way as the .bgen file

## Sample and Variant QC

### Sample QC

**Primary sample QC parameters for GWAS from ukb_sqc_v2.txt file:**
  * in.white.British.ancestry.subset==1
  * used.in.pca.calculation==1
  * excess.relatives==0
  * putative.sex.chromosome.aneuploidy==0

**Additional QC parameters**
  * Samples withdrawn un UK Biobank update = 8 
  * Samples redacted = 3 ([-3,-2,-1] in the sample ID) 

**Pre/post QC sample counts**
  * Samples removed from QC file = 151180
  * Samples retained in QC file = 337199
  * NOTE: all samples retained are in the .bgen files
  * NOTE: The ukb_sqc_v2.txt file has more samples than the .bgen files, but the same number of samples as the application specific .sample file

**Description of inclusion parameters:**

```
het.missing.outliers		      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates samples identified as outliers in heterozygosity and missing rates, which indicates poor-quality genotypes for these samples.
putative.sex.chromosome.aneuploidy    (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates samples identified as putatively carrying sex chromosome configurations that are not either XX or XY. These were identified by looking at average log2Ratios for Y and X chromosomes. See genotype QC documentation for details.
in.kinship.table		      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates samples which have at least one relative among the set of genotyped individuals. These are exactly the set of samples that appear in the kinship table. See genotype QC documentation for details.
excluded.from.kinship.inference	      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates samples which were excluded from the kinship inference procedure. See genotype QC documentation for details.
excess.relatives		      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates samples which have more than 10 putative third-degree relatives in the kinship table.
in.white.British.ancestry.subset      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates samples who self-reported 'White British' and have very similar genetic ancestry based on a principal components analysis of the genotypes. See genotype QC documentation for details.
used.in.pca.calculation		      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates samples which were used to compute principal components. All samples with genotype data were subsequently projected on to each of the 40 computed components. See genotype QC documentation for details.
in.Phasing.Input.chr1_22	      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates sample was in the input for phasing of chr1-chr22.
in.Phasing.Input.chrX		      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates sample was in the input for phasing of chrX.
in.Phasing.Input.chrXY		      (0/1)	(no/yes) Indicates sample was in the input for phasing of chrXY.

## Association in Hail

SNP association is performed on UKBB imputed dosage BGEN files using hail on a google cloud platform.

* [Hail](https://hail.is/) scalable genetic analyses
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) cluster computation and data storage
* [Cloud Tools](https://github.com/Nealelab/cloudtools) script submission to compute clusters

This allows us to take advantage of large cluster computing and parallel processing via Apache Spark

### Association model
 * **To expedite our initial GWAS, we implemented a linear regression model on all phenotypes**
 * Linear regression model covariates were inferred sex and the first 10 PCs (taken directly from ukb_sqc_v2.txt)
 * Hail's [linreg3] command allowed us to run associations on blocks of phenotypes with the same missingness structure at the same time to speed up analysis
 * However, memory constraints limited our blocks to:
    * 110 phenotypes when the missingness structure of all phenotypes is the same
    * 37 phenotypes when each phenotype has a different missingness structure
 * A critical consideration in designing the association pipeline was to avoid commands that would invoke shuffles in Spark

### Workflow for running associations in Hail for phenotypes across multiple applications:
   1)  Merge chromosome-specific `ukb_mfi_chr*_v2.txt` files into one `ukb_mfi_v2.tsv` file with a chromosome field
   2)  Merge `ukb_sqc_v2.txt` sample QC file with application-specific sample IDs using application-specific .fam files
   3)  Create application-specific Hail keytables with application-specific sample ID, inferred sex (from `ukb_sqc_v2.txt`) and the first 10 PCs (also from `ukb_sqc_v2.txt`), subset to the set of 337,199 samples outlined above
   4)  Build application-specific 'pipelines', where each pipeline is defined by a Hail keytable with (for the subset of 337,199 samples):
     * application-specific sample ID
     * inferred sex
     * PCs 1-10
     * A block of phenotypes capable of being run through linreg3 in one pass of reading in BGEN -> writing out results keytable
   5)  Create a sites-only VDS for all 92,693,895 sites in the imputed data with:
     * rsid
     * info score (from `ukb_mfi_v2.tsv`)
     * flag indicating if site is in HRC 1.1 release (`HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.wgs.mac5.sites.tab` file from http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/site)
     * variant QC metrics from Hail's `variant_qc()` method, calculated on the subset of 337,199 samples
   6)  Create a filtered sites-only VDS with 10,894,596 variants, that satisfy the criteria:
     * HRC site
     * info score > 0.8
     * 0.001 < AF < 0.999
     * pHWE > 1e-10
     * callRate > 0.95
   7)  Run associations using linreg3, where for each pipeline (see step 4) in each application, we:
     * Read in the BGENs
     * Use the filtered sites-only VDS created in step (6) to filter variants
     * Annotate samples with the pipeline-specific keytable
     * Call the linreg3 command once for each group of phenotypes in the pipeline with the same missingness structure
     * Write out association results to a Hail keytable
   8)  Export a separate tsv results file (described below) and LDSC summary stat file for each phenotype in each pipelines across all applications
